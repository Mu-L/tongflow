/**
 * Provider-neutral tool definitions for agent-driven graph editing.
 *
 * Each entry is `{ name, description, parameters }` where `parameters` is a
 * JSON Schema — wrap them in whatever envelope your LLM provider expects
 * (OpenAI `{type:"function", function}`, Anthropic `input_schema`, …) and
 * dispatch on `name` to the matching function in this module's siblings
 * (`applyGraphPatch`, `readCanvas`, `validateWorkflow`, `describeNodeType`).
 * Descriptions are prescriptive about *when* to use each tool — that is what
 * keeps a model from inventing uuids or rebuilding graphs it should patch.
 *
 * Persistence tools (list / load / save a workflow) are host concerns and are
 * intentionally not defined here.
